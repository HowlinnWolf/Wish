"Wish" by Kryder, 2022

I was pulled by the darkness
A moving target
A perfect storm

Want to break the silence
All too quiet
Before dawn

Sometimes things will fall away
Just keep moving on
Keep holding strong

Sometimes we’re all led astray
But we’re never alone
We find our way home

Wish you were closer to me
Wish it turned out differently
But the night is young and infinite
To do it over again
And find a happier end
Maybe all it takes is a wish
